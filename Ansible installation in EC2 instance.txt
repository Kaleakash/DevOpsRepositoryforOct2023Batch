node name 			public key 					private key 
ansible server 		PublicIPs: 54.166.203.211    	PrivateIPs: 172.31.39.164
node1				PublicIPs: 34.235.162.17    		PrivateIPs: 172.31.37.187
node2				PublicIPs: 54.147.191.95    		PrivateIPs: 172.31.35.144



sudo su 		to move root user 
or 
sudo - i


please install these command in ansible server instance 

sudo apt-get update 
sudo apt-get install software-properties-common 
sudo apt-add-repository ppa:ansible/ansible
sudo apt-get update 
sudo apt-get install ansible 

Now we will add the host details in Ansible Server 

sudo vi /etc/ansible/hosts 

[default]
privateIpAddress
privateIpAddress


Add all nodes ip address details inside this file ie private IP Address 

sudo vi /etc/ansible/ansible.cfg 
 
[defaults]
inventory=/etc/ansible/hosts
sudo-user=root


SSH Client Configuration 

Now create a user 			do this steps in all nodes 	in all node move to root user. 
sudo adduser ansible 


This ansible user don't have sudo privileges right now
we need to give the all privileges 

sudo vi /etc/sudoers						do this step in all nodes 
%ansible ALL=(ALL:ALL) NOPASSWD:ALL



in all nodes we need to switch to ansible user 
su - ansible 


After set all details in all nodes  

now switch to ansible user in all nodes and run the command as 
sudo apt-get update 



Now we need to establish the connection  


Now in Ansible node type as 
ssh PrivateIPAddressOfNode 

May you will get the Output as permission denied. 
This is due to SSH restrictions. 

move the root user ie exit 

sudo vi /etc/ssh/sshd_config

and edit the information 

PasswordAuthentication yes
PubkeyAuthentication yes



Now please restart the service 		to this task in all nodes 

sudo service ssh restart 
sudo service ssh status 


Now switch to the Ansible server node 
then write 
ssh NodeIpAddress 

Now from ansible server or master node if you want to connect to node1 or node2 we need to enter the password 
So now we will see how to configure ssh key to connect to node1 or node2 from server node 
now in master or ansible node write the command as 

ssh-keygen 			(ssh means Secure Socket Shell,Ssh-keygen is a tool for creating new authentication key pairs for SSH)
please hit enter key again and again 
after key generated 
ls -a 		(to check the .ssh folder)
cd .ssh 	(move inside that folder)
ssh-copy-id ansible@PrivateIPAddressOfNode1
 
ssh-copy-id ansible@privateIpAddress

After this we can connect from ansible node to node1 using one command as 

ssh 'ansible@PrivateIpAddress'

Now we will connect node2 using ssh-copy-id command 


please do same for all nodes but while creating ssh-keygen create new file for each node.
